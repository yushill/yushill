- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yushill

I use GitHub for personal projects that, by nature, are not related to a unique domain of application.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Computer Science, and Virtuous Engineering.

Open-minded and curious-by-nature I initially studied physics science.
Increasingly seduced by computer science I switched and finally obtained a PhD in the field of parallel programming and processing.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Julia

Skilled C++ programmer, Python enthusiast, irrational Java antagonist, the rest is OK
